# Dot-files

Here are some of my dotfiles for vim, zsh, p10k etc. I hope this helps someone with their pick of a theme and maybe someone will like it! So, enjoy... I guess?

# Requierments

This is a list of requierments for this thing to work!

| Item | Reason |

| Linux or MacOS | You will need one of these systems in order to have the dot files as a concept |
| Vim | You will need vim to use the .vimrc and the .vim folder |
| Oh-My-Zsh | You need this in order to have a terminal theme |
| Vim-Plug | To use the plugins in the .vimrc config |
| ZSH | This is a shell used for these configs |
